# Unreleased

- `list_develop_presets` now returns up to 100 presets by default. Use `limit` and `offset` to page through matches until `has_more` is false. `count` is the total after filtering, including when `limit` is 0.
- Narrow preset discovery with `query` (case-insensitive name substring) and `folder` (exact, case-sensitive folder name). Use `Plugin Develop Presets` for plugin checkpoints.
- Preset list rows now contain only `name`, `folder`, `scope` and `uuid`. Use `get_develop_preset` with `preset_uuid` to retrieve `file`. Other preset tool results and selectors are unchanged.
